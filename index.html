<p>Hurricane Willa was a powerful tropical cyclone that brought torrential rains and destructive winds to the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit in October 2018. It was the twenty-second named storm, thirteenth hurricane, and tenth major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, and tied a record as that season's third Category 5 hurricane. Willa originated from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea that crossed over Central America into the East Pacific without significant organization. On October 20 the system developed into a tropical depression, and strengthened later in the day into Tropical Storm Willa. It peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) two days later. On October 24, Willa made landfall in Sinaloa as a marginal Category 3 hurricane. It killed nine people, and caused more than MXN$16 billion (US$820 million) in damage. (This article is part of a featured topic: Category 5 Pacific hurricanes.)</p>
